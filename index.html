    <h1>Cloud Computing</h1>
    <p>
        Cloud computing is like renting someone else's computer power and storage over the internet, 
        rather than owning and managing your own hardware. 
        It’s super flexible and scalable, meaning you can adjust how much you use based on your needs. 
        You get to access your data and applications from anywhere with an internet connection, which makes collaboration and remote work a breeze. 
        No need for heavy investments in physical infrastructure—just pay for what you use
