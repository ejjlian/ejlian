        <h2>Cloud Computing</h2>
        <p>
            Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services—including servers, storage, databases, networking, software, and analytics—over the internet (the cloud) to offer faster innovation, flexible resources, and economies of scale. Common models of cloud computing include:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service):</strong> Provides virtualized computing resources over the internet.</li>
            <li><strong>PaaS (Platform as a Service):</strong> Allows developers to build and run applications without managing the underlying infrastructure.</li>
            <li><strong>SaaS (Software as a Service):</strong> Delivers software applications over the internet, on demand.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="network-provider">
        <h2>Network Providers</h2>
        <p>
            Network providers, also known as Internet Service Providers (ISPs), are companies that provide access to the internet and other related services like hosting. Examples include:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>AT&T:</strong> Provides both wireless and broadband internet services across the U.S.</li>
            <li><strong>Globe Telecom:</strong> A major ISP in the Philippines offering mobile data and fiber internet services.</li>
            <li><strong>Verizon:</strong> A leading global communications and technology solutions provider.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            These providers use a combination of physical cables (fiber, copper) and wireless technologies to offer their services. The speed, reliability, and reach of a network provider’s service depend on its infrastructure.
        </p>

    <section id="virtualization">
        <h2>Virtualization</h2>
        <p>
            Virtualization is the creation of a virtual (rather than physical) version of something, such as an operating system, server, storage device, or network resources. The key benefits of virtualization include:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Resource Optimization:</strong> Allows multiple virtual machines (VMs) to run on a single physical server, maximizing resource usage.</li>
            <li><strong>Cost Efficiency:</strong> Reduces the need for multiple physical servers, cutting down costs.</li>
            <li><strong>Scalability:</strong> Makes it easier to scale up or down resources as needed without purchasing additional hardware.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            One common example is server virtualization. With a tool like VMware or Hyper-V, you can divide a physical server into multiple virtual machines, each running its own operating system.
